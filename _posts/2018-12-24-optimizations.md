### Merry Christmas!

I am currently optimizing Cubz engine.
and here are the last videos before christmas:

What the user views:
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
	<source src="/Cubz/assets/videos/cubz_opts_1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	Your browser does not support the video tag :(
</video>

What is actually happening:
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
	<source src="/Cubz/assets/videos/cubz_opts_2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	Your browser does not support the video tag :(
</video>
