title: HUD Finished!
---

It's been long since last post, 2 months and a half, but today, we're here to announce that the
so much waited HUD is finally finished, after a lot of optimizations like frustum culling, some fixes,
and NanoVG using. HUD system is finally complete! Pictures are coming soon, when collision with terrain
will be finished. Which may take some days. Anyway, see ya for another article about Cubz!
