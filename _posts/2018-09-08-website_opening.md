**Yep!** Today Cubz's official website is getting launched



I was sure you was hyped! Even if that game is so much ALPHA, and nothing is possible, i made this for the future :D
Anyway, I'm the Admin of the website + Validator + Developer, TLB is Developer + Article Writer

### But why ?

It's because Cubz is an ambitious project, and of course, it needed a website so everyone playing it can know what is happening!
The staff may grow, contributors may come, and players may.. play! Maybe we'll add multiplayer, release new versions, create a account
system, etc., this website has been made for that
